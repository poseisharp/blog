[{"content":"Circles!   Well, tbh it\u0026rsquo;s quite a stretch to call these circles, it\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of deformed eggs at best.\nHowever, I now somehwat know that I have a lot to work on, a bit daunting but I have a clear path.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll continue to draw more circles for the next couple of days until I get the hang of it, then I\u0026rsquo;ll move on.\n","description":"This is the moment of embarking","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Let's start with circles","uri":"http://posei.me/posts/en/lets-start-with-circle/"},{"content":"Failed Attemps I\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to start learning how to draw for quite some time now but for some reason I always ended up dropping it, probably commitment issues xd.

Futhermore, this time I have a clear actionable goal in mind\nThe Plan I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to do daily exercices every morning for 1-3 hours and I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure to take not toddler steps not even baby steps I will take Hallucigenia steps, if there\u0026rsquo;s anything I learned from past failures it would be knowing that taking big step and failing is the most discouraging things in the entire universe.\nAnd by Hallucigenia steps I mean it, I\u0026rsquo;ll start with primitive shapes tomorrow.\n","description":"This is the moment of embarking","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Auspicious Start","uri":"http://posei.me/posts/en/auspicious-start/"},{"content":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Posei a spaghet maker, the less common term for it is programmer, mainly doing mobile stuff with flutter. I also like other stuff such as music and art but suck at creating both, that\u0026rsquo;s why I created this blog, I want to document my learning process on both so maybe I can be more consistent.\nThis site is created with Hugo\nIt\u0026rsquo;s awesome, go check it out!\n","description":"Posei about page","id":4,"section":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"http://posei.me/about/"}]
